# ✨ AutoGLM Android Assistant | Your Autonomous Phone Agent 🤖

This is a **Standalone Android Version** of AutoGLM. No PC required, no ADB setup, no complex environment. Just install the APK and run! 🚀

---

## 🌟 Why Choose This Version? (vs Original AutoGLM)

### ❌ Original AutoGLM:
*   💻 **Requires PC**: Must be connected to a computer to run.
*   🐍 **Complex Setup**: Needs Python, ADB, and dependency management.
*   🔌 **Unstable Connection**: ADB cables or wireless debugging often disconnect.
*   🐢 **High Latency**: Screen capture -> PC -> Model -> ADB Command loop is slow.

### ✅ My Native Android Version:
*   📱 **Fully Independent**: **Just install the APK!** The phone is the brain. Run it anywhere. 🏃‍♂️
*   ⚡️ **Zero Configuration**: No environment setup. No code. Works out of the box! 🎉
*   🖐️ **Native Control**: Uses Android Accessibility Service for smooth clicks and swipes.
*   🗣️ **Voice Interaction**: Built-in voice recognition. Just speak your commands! 🎙️
*   👀 **Real-time Feedback**: **Floating Window** shows exactly what the AI is thinking and doing.

## 1. Quick Start

### Step 1: Grant Necessary Permissions
When opening the app for the first time, grant these two key permissions:
*   **Accessibility Service**: Allows AI to click, swipe, and read screen content. 👆
*   **Overlay Permission**: Displays the AI status floating window over other apps. 💬

### Step 2: Configure API Key
This app uses Zhipu AI's vision model. You need an API Key:
1.  Get a key from [Zhipu AI Open Platform](https://bigmodel.cn/usercenter/proj-mgmt/apikeys).
2.  Go to App **Settings** -> **Enter API Key** -> Paste and Save. ✅

### Step 3: Start Using
*   **Text Command**: Type "Open YouTube and search for funny cats" 🔍
*   **Voice Command**: Hold the mic button, speak, and release!
*   Click **Send**, then **hands off the screen** and watch it work! 😎

---

## 2. Floating Window Status

*   🟢 **Green (Ready)**: Idle and waiting for commands.
*   ⚪ **Gray (Running)**: Thinking or executing actions. **Do not touch the screen!** 🤫
*   🔴 **Red (Error)**: Something went wrong. Click "Stop" to reset.

---

## 3. FAQ
*   **No action performed?** Check if Accessibility Service was killed by the system. Re-enable it.
*   **API Key Invalid?** Check for extra spaces or account balance.
